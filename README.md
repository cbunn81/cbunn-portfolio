# cbunn.com - My personal website and portfolio

Hi there. Thanks for checking out my repo. This is a personal website and portfolio made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

I've tried to showcase various projects that I've built over the last few years. Each project has its data stored in an MDX file which is consumed using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

I'm also an amateur photographer, so I've included a page with some featured photos. I'm hoping to build out a more elaborate gallery to hold many more photos in a folder-like structure. But that is on the back burner for now.
