Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] As it doesn't seem possible (or at least worth the trouble) to add a CSS filter onto a Next Image, darken the light mode image directly and re-upload.  
- [ ] In mobile, change the menu such that when another page is chosen, the menu re-hides. As of now, the menu has to be manually closed after navigating to another page.  
- [ ] Sort out negative space between hero heading and text on the home page and the projects on the projects page.  
- [ ] Consider a placeholder method or a way to preload hero images so that when the color mode is changed, the delay in changing them is less annoying.  
- [ ] Add anchor to project headings  
- [ ] Create blog pages  
- [ ] Create photo page  

### In Progress

- [ ] Use next-seo to handle head elements like title, description, open graph data
