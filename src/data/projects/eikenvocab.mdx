This is a command-line application which will quickly and easily generate vocabulary flashcards based on the most frequent English words used in previous Eiken exams.

The application will download the tests from the web, scrape them for English words (cross-referenced with a dictionary API), sort them by frequency and use public APIs to generate Japanese translations and pronunciations for the words. The word list is sent to a Google Sheets spreadsheet where it can be manually checked. When a user is ready, they can use the application to use this word list to generate PDF files for the flashcards.

There are plenty of study materials available for Eiken tests, but we wanted to create materials that comprehensively cover all the vocabulary that commonly appears.

Google Sheets is used to store the word list as it is an accessible option for all team members. HTML and CSS are used for the flashcard design using Jinja as a templating engine. And Python is used for all functionality.
