checkr is a terminal application which checks for file integrity. It can scan a directory or list of directories, generating checksum digests for all files, and it can subsequently check those files to see if the checksum digests have changed, which would indicate either a modification or a corruption of the file.

There are two options for storage of the results: an SQLite database or a CSV file. By default, a database is used, but a CSV file can be selected. There are several options which can be set either by a config file or as arguments on the command itself.
