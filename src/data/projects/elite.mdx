This is a command-line application which will quickly and easily generate a full set of PDFs for a business English curriculum with a standard template and content pulled from Google Sheets.

Creating lesson materials by hand can be a tedious, time-consuming process. It is also prone to error and inconsistency. Errors can be introduced by copying and pasting without paying close attention to the details. Inconsistency can arise when changes are made over time to either the presentation or the structure of the content in each lesson. This application eliminates those concerns and allows for efficient document management at scale.

The content of all lessons is managed through a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows for a common, user-friendly interface which can be used by all members of the team. The presentation of the lessons is controlled by HTML/CSS templates using Jinja as a templating engine. Finally, a Python application is used to combine the two by scraping the content for each lesson from the spreadsheet, inserting it into the template and producing a PDF document for each lesson.
