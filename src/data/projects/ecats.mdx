This is a full-stack web application to test students on English grammar and vocabulary using multiple choice questions. This application saves teachers' time by administering the tests remotely and asynchronously. Questions are formulated to focus on a particular grammar or vocabulary point.

First, students begin the test by entering their email address as well as a code given to them by the school. In the test, when a student chooses an answer, the test automatically advances to the next question. There is a timer set for each question, and if a student does not submit an answer before the timer runs out, that question is marked as incorrect and the test advances to the next question. When the student has completed all questions, the test generates a report on their performance, indicating which abilities they can perform and which they cannot.

The backend is Django (DRF) with PostgreSQL. The frontend is React with Redux Toolkit, RTK-Query and Material UI. Deployment is through Docker. The project is still under development and has not been released for production yet.
